been categorized into fiction and non-fiction using Goodreads. I am doing an analysis of the dataset to identify, understand and visualize the book market trends over the past
decade. I am trying to measure the bestselling books for the past decade, the books with the highest review for the past decade, the best authors based on book rating, the
best book based on the number of reviews and the overall market share for the past decade for each genre of books.
B. Consider key stakeholders: The main stakeholders here is me Victor Sanchez as I am undertaking this capstone project to earn the Google Data Analytics Certification. Other

Amazon's bestselling books from 2009 to 2019, categorized into fiction and nonfiction.
• Data Limitations: It is good to note that the data being analyzed covers only the years 2009 up to 2019. Since the data is not current, and uses a small sample size. The results of the analysis may not be fully aligned with current usage trends.
